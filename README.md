# Photolabs
PhotoLabs is a React project that allows users to view and like photos. This project allowed for learning new techniques for building React applications such as custom hooks, routes, and conditional rendering. The backend allows us to connect our React app to a photo API to dynamically receive new photos. Some of the technologies used for this project include React (create-react-app), Express, Node, and SASS.
